<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Ashley and this is a showcase of my coding journey this year.
     I am currently a highschool student taking the computer science course this quadmester. 
     I have crafted and computed this website as part of my new journey in learning coding. 
     Outside my life at school, I have many interests that I take part in during my free time. 
     I enjoy listening to music, reading/writing, and drawing. I love to express myself through 
     different mediums of art such as paintings, music, makeup, etc. I hope I can show my creativity 
     through future assignments in this course.</p>
